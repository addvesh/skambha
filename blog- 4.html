<p>"Health is like money, we will never have 
    a true idea of its value until we lost" is 
    a very significant statement of Josh Billings.</p>

    <h4> Overview</h4>
   <p>India is a democratically-governed country. 
    It is true that India is endowed country, 
    and establishing a stronger health system is 
    a major undertaking. Around 70% of India's population 
    lives in rural areas. and the government is responsible 
    for providing primary health care to the population. 
    So, government is always working to improve access to 
    primary health care. Health is a fundamental human right, 
    and the Constitution recognises it as such in Article 21.
    </p>

   <p>The Indian health-care system has seen significant 
       changes in the twenty-first century, although there 
       remain significant variations between cities and 
       countryside. In India, where public-sector health-care 
       institutions produce poor results, there has been 
       a significant migration toward private-sector hospitals. 
       Furthermore, the cost of doing business in the private sector 
       is much higher than in the public sector. However, the 
       administration is now putting its potential into action, 
       and better services are being perceived.</p>

       <h4> Definition and concepts of health system-</h4>
    <p>The health system encompasses a wide range of 
        health activities, health programmes, medical care 
        institutions such as hospitals, clinics, and primary 
        health care centres, as well as government policies aimed 
        at delivering the best possible health care to its population.
        WHO defines a health system as "the sum total of all the 
        organisations, institutions, and resources whose 
        primary objective is to immunise people."
        </p>

        <h4>	Component of health system-</h4>
        <p> Health System Includes - 
            Concepts which refers to health and diseases
            Ideas refers to equity                                                                                     
            Objects refers to hospitals, health centres
             Persons refers to health care workers viz. physician, nurses
            </p>

    <h4> Current Scenario of Health-Care System in Indian- </h4>

    <p>Currently in terms of revenue and employment, 
        healthcare has become one of India's most important 
        industries. Hospitals, medical devices, clinical trials, 
        outsourcing, telemedicine, medical tourism, health insurance, 
        and medical equipment are all part of the healthcare industry. 
        The Indian healthcare system is expanding rapidly as a result of 
        expanding coverage, services, and public and private sector financing.
        India's healthcare delivery system is divided into two categories 
        i.e. public and private sector. The government, or public healthcare 
        system, has a limited number of secondary and tertiary care institutions 
        in major cities and focuses on delivering basic healthcare in rural regions 
        through primary healthcare centres (PHCs). The private sector supplies the 
        bulk of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary care facilities, with metros, 
        tier I, and tier II cities having the highest concentration.
</p>

    <h4> COVID-19 Impact on the Healthcare-</h4>

    <p> It is now clear that the COVID 19 epidemic will 
        place a substantial strain on our already scarce 
        healthcare resources.  According to an initial study 
        on coronavirus infectivity an infected patient will 
        infect the other two people, during the initial phase of 
        epidemic. The exact number of people who may be affected 
        in the near future is difficult to predict. COVID-19 takes 
        roughly 67 days to infect the first one lakh people, 
        according to the World Health Organization, and just 
        12 days to infect the following one lakh. The next one 
        lakh became infected in just four days. Globally, the 
        number of confirmed cases is now about 41.7 lakh.</p>

        <p>The coronavirus pandemic has posed numerous issues 
        for industrialised countries, and these challenges 
        would exacerbate for emerging countries such as India 
        as the number of infected cases rises. As a result, it 
        is our job to use healthcare resources wisely in order to 
        protect our frontline warriors. We don't have specific 
        treatment for this. So, even after vaccination, supportive 
        care for sick people and numerous prevention strategies 
        will be the only way to keep this pandemic under control.
        </p>

    <h4>Major issues faced by healthcare system in India-</h4> 
    <p>	Shortage of doctor- According to a WHO report, India's doctor-density ratio is 8 per 10,000 people, compared to one doctor per 1000 people. The same message is conveyed by India Spread's data.
        </p>

        <p>	Finance- Because they cannot afford care, 
            the majority of Indians do not seek treatment even after 
            becoming aware of their ailment. Around 70% of medical 
            expenses come from the patient's own pocket.</p>

        <p> Poor Public Health Infrastructure - People are forced 
            to seek medical care at private hospitals due to a lack 
            of public health infrastructure, which pushes them into 
            poverty. Only 7% of sub-health centres and 12% of primary 
            health centres fulfil Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) requirements, 
            indicating a lack of PHCs (22%) and sub-health centres (20%).</p>


    <p> Insurance- The majority of people do not have health 
        insurance because they cannot afford it. In comparison to 
        83.5 percent in the UK, the government contributes 
        around 32 percent to insurance.</p>

        <p>	 Poor healthcare ranking: India is ranked 145th out of 195 
            countries in terms of healthcare quality and accessibility, 
            trailing only Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>	 Commercial motive: lack of transparency and unethical 
        practices in the private sector. These private hospitals are opened by 
        some business personnel merely for monetary gains.
        </p>
       <p>	Flop schemes: The government has devised a number 
           of programmes. However, they have failed to upgrade 
           the system and make it more user-friendly. In the 
           absence of uniform and large increases in health 
           spending by States, the NHM's share of the health budget 
           declined from 73 percent in 2006 to 50 percent in 2019. 
    </p> 
    So, all of this must be done by the government, 
    because it is the only body capable of working without 
    regard for profit. If the government is unable to pay, 
    it should at the very least make it simple for private 
    clinics and consulting doctors to open private hospitals 
    and procedures. At the meantime, the government appears to 
    be doing exactly the opposite. Duties on medical equipment 
    are being reduced. Providing hospitals with subsidized power 
    and water. Small clinics will be able to grow into full-fledged 
    centres thanks to a government agreement to manage biological 
    waste. Doctors are present, but they lack the financial means to 
    purchase instruments and scans... As a result, several small clinics 
    appear, none of which are equipped to treat a 
    patient in a true emergency. Either way, it's a waste.</p>

Sri Lanka. Source: India Spend, January 2018.</p>
 <p>
2. 70 percent of the overall household expenditure 
on health in the country is on medicines. Source: WHO</p>
<p>

have an operation theatre and 29% lacked a labour 
room, community health centres were short of 81.5% 
specialists–surgeon, gynaecologists and paediatricians. Source: India Spend, January 2018 </p>

<p>5. In 2014, 58% Indians in rural areas and 68% 
    in urban areas said they use private facilities 
    for inpatient care, according to the 71st round 
    of the National Sample Survey Source: India Spend, January 2018</p>
 <p>
6. Various studies have shown the rising
 out-of-pocket expenditures on healthcare is 
 pushing around 32-39 million 
 Indians below the poverty line annually. <p>

<p>7. Heart disease (1/4 people) and stroke is 
    the biggest killer of men and women in India. </p>
 
 <p>8. 7% of Indians fall below the poverty 
     line just because of indebtedness due to this expenditure, 
     as well as that this figure hasn’t changed much 
     in a decade. About 23% of the sick can’t afford 
     healthcare because of these payments. </p>
<p>
9. 55 million Indians were pushed into 
poverty in a single year due to unaffordable 
healthcare. (PHFI, 2018)</p>
 <p>
 10. 33 out of 55 million fell under the poverty 
 line due to expenditure on medicines alone. (PHFI, 2018)</p>


 <h4><a href= “https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/india”  >
    	Initiative to improve health care system in India- 
    </a></h4>
    
    <p>India has initiated a number of reforms that 
        could have far-reaching implications for the 
        health sector and the broader economy. These include: </p>
    <p>
    -	Launching Ayushman Bharat, which encompasses 
    the National Health Protection Scheme (Pradhan Mantri 
    Jan Arogya Yojana), for coverage of tertiary care for 
    vulnerable populations and Health and Wellness Centres 
    initiative for the delivery of comprehensive 
    and integrated primary care.</p>
    <p>
    -	Setting up the National Health Authority to implement the PM-JAY.</p>
    <p>
    -	Initiating the provision of universal sanitation 
    coverage and making the country open defecation–free 
    through the Swachch Bharat Mission.
    </p>
    <p>
    -	Launching Intensified Mission Indradhanush 2.0 
    to achieve 90 percent vaccination coverage for children under 2.</p>
    <p>
    -	Providing clean cooking fuel under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
    -	Providing nutritional and social support for all National Health Protection Scheme.</p>
    
    <h4>
    	Conclusion-</h4>
    
    <p>India has made it a priority to provide complete 
        care for both mother and child. It has developed 
        policies that enable for the inclusive design and 
        execution of neonatal care programmes. However, when 
        examining the rate at which the targets have been met 
        thus far, as well as the pace at which they will be met 
        in the future, it has to concentrate more on policy formulation 
        in terms of increasing the capacity of current human resources, 
        increasing the amount of money committed to new-born care, and 
        finding areas through operational research that might improve the 
        quantity and quality of new-born care in India. We need to 
        operationalize and move forward now that the roadmap has been determined.</p>
